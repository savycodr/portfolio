# personal-portfolio
A portfolio to display my projects, resume, and contact information.

## Instructions

* This is a single page portfolio. There is a menu button on the upper left side for easier traversal. 

* In the ABOUT section of the website there is a link to email me. There are also links to my Github and Linkedin accounts. There is a link to my resume.

* In the PORTFOLIO section there is a card for each of my projects. If you click on the card's image, it will appear larger. You can click on a link to see the projec's code in Github. You can also click on a link to the deployed application.

## Technology

* This webpage uses Materialize's CSS and javascript library.

* The menu button is affixed to the top left corner. It remains visible as the user scrolls. It has some opacity so that the user can read through the button.

* The webpage is media responsive and can be used on phones and tablets. The parallax is shut off for phones because the images do not scroll smoothly.

* I used colormind.io to design the color scheme.

* Utilizes a google font called Arimo by Steve Matteson.
